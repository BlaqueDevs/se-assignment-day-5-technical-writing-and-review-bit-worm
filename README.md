When you understand what level your audience it at, you will be able to choose the level of technicality when deliverying your information. For the less technical audience, you will deliver the information in an easy to understand way, you will use analogies and more visuals to deliver the info. For the more technical audience, you can use technical words and they will get you, but you should also not be too technical because you want to be understood as much as possible.

## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?

For a less knowledgable aoudience like kids, you wanna use many visuals to keep things interesting and keep their attention.

For profesinal audience like managers in a company, you use words that are straight to the point short and easy to understand.

For technical audince like developers, you use technical words which they will relate to and understand right away.

## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?

You could look at their level of eduction which will give you a sence of how much knowledge they might have gathered.

Their career is also a way to tell what they know and what might be new to them.

Their level of experience in a certain feild/career could also indicate how much they know.

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?

The use of analogies will provide a simple way to relate to what you are trying to pass.

Using visuals also provides an easy way to see and get the point you are trying to make.

Using examples will show them what you are trying to say is practical.

## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?

## 8. What types of visuals (e.g., diagrams, charts) are most effective for different kinds of technical information?

For things involving statistics and lots of numbers, it is safe to use charts to simplify the information.
